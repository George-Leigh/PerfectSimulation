# PerfectSimulation
R scripts for examples in journal article "Perfect simulation from unbiased simulation" by G. M. Leigh, W.-H. Yang, M. E. Wickens
and A. R. Northrop.  The authors would appreciate citation of that article in any work that uses the code.  Scripts include the
one used to create the figures for the article, which loads RData files written by the other scripts.

The scripts contain R functions, followed by the code to run them and show the results.  The latter code is intended to be run
interactively, line by line, not using the "source" function.  Results are saved to RData files.

The scripts are written in base R with no external packages required.
